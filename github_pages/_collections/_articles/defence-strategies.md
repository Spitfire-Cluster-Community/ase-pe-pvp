## Turret Info

| Turret | Base Damage | Range | Target | Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 Turret | 1M | 3000,8000,10000 | Single | - |
| T2 Turret | 5M | 3000,8000,10000 | Single | - |
| T3 Turret | 50M | 3000,8000,10000 | Single | - |
| T4 Turret | 150M | 3000,8000,10000 | Single | All ammo is considered AP. Does not need power. |
| Laser Turret | 45% of Max Health | 3000,8000,10000 | Single | Slow fire rate (charges up to fire) |
| LRM Turret | 75K | 10000,150000,200000| AOE | BUG: Does zero damage. |
| Bola Turret | <100 | 3000,8000,10000 | Single | Can bola any creatures and players. |

> [!TIP]
> A basic strategy is mostly T2 with AP ammo and spread in some Laser, Ice and Bola turrets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Set LRM to target `Players/Tames/Players&Tames Only` or it targets wilds in huge AOE and causes server lag.

> [!NOTE]
> Spitfire turrets account for armor from a saddle or stone, but resistance from the creature does not count. A creature with 90% resistance and a Dodo with 0% will get hit the same.
