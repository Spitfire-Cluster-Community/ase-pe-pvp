# Todo

- new frontmatter has been added "grows_from", however this should probably be a recipe as it needs a certain structure to grow in.  Consider adding a "type" to recipies (type=craft/cook/grow/etc)
- sort can_craft by title
- dropped_by doesn't seem to be working (see spitfire essence)
- term pages - use the broken link checker
- glossary page (searchable, etc)
- change term link to allow any collection (collection link) then use this to link to articles
