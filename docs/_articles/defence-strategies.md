<div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-important">
<p class="markdown-alert-title">Important</p>
<p>Set LRM to target `Players/Tames/Players&Tames Only` or it targets wilds in huge AOE and causes server lag.</p>
</div>

<div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-note">
<p class="markdown-alert-title">Note</p>
<p>Spitfire turrets account for armor from a saddle or stone, but resistance from the creature does not count. A creature with 90% resistance and a Dodo with 0% will get hit the same.</p>
</div>

<div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-tip">
<p class="markdown-alert-title">Tip</p>
<p>A basic strategy is mostly T2 with mixed ammo types and spread in some Laser.  Mix in som T3/T4 if you have them.</p>
</div>
