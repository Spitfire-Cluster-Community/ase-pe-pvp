## Resource Farming

At SpitfireCluster resources can be grown, and even duplicated!

### Seeds

Use seeds and crop plots to upgrade to a {% include term-link.html title="Spitfire Tek Crop Plot Tier 2" %}.  This can be used to bulk-duplicate most resources.

You can make the Spitfire Essence seeds in the {% include term-link.html title="Spitfire Crop Bench" %}, or kill the bosses from the seed bench to get a bunch at random (If the bosses don't show, pickup and replace the bench).
