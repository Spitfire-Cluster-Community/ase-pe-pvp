## Upgrading Creature Stats

Use the {% include term-link.html title="Dino Upgrade Table" %} to craft the items needed to transfer creature's base stats, for example from Food to Melee, Health, Stamina, Speed.

The {% include term-link.html title="Eternal Kibble Bench" %} can craft the kibble needed for upgrade items.

## Breeding Creature Stats

If you want to take the effort you can cross-breed and merge all the stats into one creature. This simply involves breeding the creatures with the best stats and keeping the baby with the best of all the stats.
