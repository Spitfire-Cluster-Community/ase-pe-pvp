## How to upgrade an item to max stats

Using structures from the Upgrade Station mod you can max out the stats of tools, weapons and armor.

1.  Use the {% include link.html collection="glossary" title="Blueprint Station" %} to convert an item to a blueprint.
2.  Craft an item from the blueprint, note that the stats increased.
3.  Use the {% include link.html collection="glossary" title="Blueprint Station" %} to convert the improved item to a blueprint.
4.  Craft an item from the improved blueprint, note that the stats increased again.
5.  Repeat steps 3-4 until the stats max out. You may want to keep a capped blueprint so you can skip this process next time you want to make the item.

<p class="markdown-alert-title">Note</p>
<p>The upgrade doesn't work if the item has base stats, so use the {% include link.html collection="glossary" title="Augment Station" %} to upgrade the stats of an item (preferred), or the {% include link.html collection="glossary" title="Upgrade Station" %} to upgrade the tier and stats of an item.</p>
</div>

<p>Upgrading the tier will increase the costs to craft an repair the item and has no other benefit. If possible keep the item at primitive tier by only using the {% include link.html collection="glossary" title="Augment Station" %}.</p>

## How to blueprint unlimited crafts

1.  Use the {% include link.html collection="glossary" title="Blueprint Station" %} to convert an item to a blueprint.
2.  Craft ONE item from the blueprint, move it to another inventory so it doesn't get mixed up.
3.  Craft the remaining items from the blueprint, it will disappear.
4.  Use the {% include link.html collection="glossary" title="Blueprint Station" %} to convert the ONE item to a blueprint.
5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until you have the desired amount of items.

<p class="markdown-alert-title">Tip</p>
<p>It's recommend to keep a dedicated Upgrade Station for items and parts with limited crafts so they don't get mixed up. Only keep blueprints here that have the maximum crafts remaining.</p>
