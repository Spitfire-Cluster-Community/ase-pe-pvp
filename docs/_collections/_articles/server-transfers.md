## Transferring Your Character

SpitfireCluster is a multi-server Ark environment.  This means your character can move freely between servers.

To learn how to transfer between servers see [fandom - CrossARK Transfers](https://ark.fandom.com/wiki/CrossARK_Transfers).

In addition to the methods described above, you can also transfer between servers using an {% include term-link.html title="Awesome Teleporter" %}.

## Transferring Items

Some items cannot be transferred between servers using the standard Transfer Character option.

You can use `/upload` to upload element and some other non-transferable items minus boss fight tributes from vanilla. The storage has a 1-hour timer. 

After transferring servers you can use `/download` if your items don't get added back to your inventory.
