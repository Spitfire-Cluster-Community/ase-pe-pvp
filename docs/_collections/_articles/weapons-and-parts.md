## Where do I get weapon parts and attachments?

Weapons parts and attachments can be found in Beaver Dams as well as Supply Drops and Loot Crates (in caves/ocean).

## How to add an attachment to a weapon 

Attachments are required to upgrade some weapons to the Legendary tier. They can also be manually added at any tier.

1. Put the weapon and the desired attachment into the {% include term-link.html title="Spitfire Armory" %}.
1. Ensure the weapon is selected then click Add Attachment .

## How to upgrade a weapon

1. Put the weapon and the required parts into the {% include term-link.html title="Spitfire Armory" %}.
1. Ensure the weapon is selected then click Upgrade Weapon.
1. The weapon will either be upgraded or it will tell you the missing parts. Repeat step 2 until the weapon is full upgraded.

> [!TIP]
> Use the {% include term-link.html title="Blueprint Station" %} to create a blueprint of your upgraded weapon incase you lose it.

> [!TIP]
> You will need multiple parts for an upgrade, it's recommended to put them directly into the {% include term-link.html title="Blueprint Station" %} and convert them to a blueprint for later use. Also see [how to blueprint unlimited crafts](../upgrading-items).
