## I'm stuck or trapped

Use the `/suicide` command to die and respawn.  This cannot be used during PvP Cooldown.

## The Awesome Teleporter menu is stuck on the screen

Press `TAB` to open the console, then you should be able to close it.

## Some mod has caused a problem

Press `TAB` to open the console, and then type `reconnect`.  This reload the mods and will solve most mod issues.
